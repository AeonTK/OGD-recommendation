    <h1>A recommender system for improved data findability in open government data portals</h1>
    <p>The research suggests that it is difficult for users of open government data (OGD) portals to find the datasets they are interested in. The objective of our research is to contribute to the solution of this problem by developing a recommendation system for datasets. This recommendation system will output possibly relevant datasets based on the chosen dataset. 
    This survey is meant to evaluate the effectiveness of this recommendation method approach. <b>Recommended datasets</b> column contains metadata about the datasets that are recommended to user based upon the dataset under <b>Main dataset</b> column. We ask you to rate the quality of recommendation under the <b>Voting</b> column and send results to us with <b>submit</b> button which will redirect you to email results to us. <b>Thank you!</b></p>

                <p><b>Description:</b> Colour raster copies of so called Imperial Obligatory Imprints of the Stable Cadastre 1:2880 - Bohemia. These maps originate in 1826-1843 and originally were intended for archiving in the Central Archive of Cadastre of Lands in Vienna. After declaration of the Czechoslovak Republic they were handed over to Prague in frame of separation of archives. In contrast to so called Original Maps of Stable Cadastre they record the original state of landscape without drawings of later changes. Up to now they belong to the most demanded and to the most used Archival documents of the Central Archive of Surveying and Cadastre. There are approximately 8400 cadastral maps in approx. 31 thousands map sheets for the territory of Bohemia. In cadastral districts where these maps were not retained, these maps are being continuously replaced by original maps of the stable cadastre.</p>

            <p><b>Title</b>: State map 1:5 000 new form raster data - Blatná 7-0</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> The product represents a new design of the State Map at a scale of 1:5,000 in raster form, whose advantages are recency and colour processing. The map contains planimetry based on cadastral map, altimetry adopted from the altimetry part of ZABAGED and map lettering based on database of geographic names Geonames and abbreviations of feature type signification coming up from attributes of selected ZABAGED features. The cartographic visualisation is solved automatically without manual works of a cartographer. This new design of the SM 5 is repeatedly generated once a year on the part of the Czech territory where the vector form of cadastral map is available. Therefore, part of export units (map sheets of SM 5) has not a full coverage (price of such export unit is then proportionally reduced).</p>

The map contains planimetry based on cadastral map, altimetry adopted from the altimetry part of ZABAGED and map lettering based on database of geographic names Geonames and abbreviations of feature type signification coming up from attributes of selected ZABAGED features. This new design of the SM 5 is repeatedly generated once a year on the part of the Czech territory where the vector form of cadastral map is available. Therefore, part of export units (map sheets of SM 5) has not a full coverage (price of such export unit is then proportionally reduced).</p>

These maps originate in 1826-1843 and originally were intended for archiving in the Central Archive of Cadastre of Lands in Vienna. After declaration of the Czechoslovak Republic they were handed over to Prague in frame of separation of archives. In contrast to so called Original Maps of Stable Cadastre they record the original state of landscape without drawings of later changes. Up to now they belong to the most demanded and to the most used Archival documents of the Central Archive of Surveying and Cadastre. There are approximately 8400 cadastral maps in approx. 31 thousands map sheets for the territory of Bohemia.

                <p><b>Description:</b> The product represents a new design of the State Map at a scale of 1:5,000 in raster form, whose advantages are recency and colour processing. The map contains planimetry based on cadastral map, altimetry adopted from the altimetry part of ZABAGED and map lettering based on database of geographic names Geonames and abbreviations of feature type signification coming up from attributes of selected ZABAGED features. The cartographic visualisation is solved automatically without manual works of a cartographer. This new design of the SM 5 is repeatedly generated once a year on the part of the Czech territory where the vector form of cadastral map is available. Therefore, part of export units (map sheets of SM 5) has not a full coverage (price of such export unit is then proportionally reduced).</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b> The product represents a new design of the State Map at a scale of 1:5,000 in raster form, whose advantages are recency and colour processing. The map contains planimetry based on cadastral map, altimetry adopted from the altimetry part of ZABAGED and map lettering based on database of geographic names Geonames and abbreviations of feature type signification coming up from attributes of selected ZABAGED features. The cartographic visualisation is solved automatically without manual works of a cartographer. This new design of the SM 5 is repeatedly generated once a year on the part of the Czech territory where the vector form of cadastral map is available. Therefore, part of export units (map sheets of SM 5) has not a full coverage (price of such export unit is then proportionally reduced).</p>

This new design of the SM 5 is repeatedly generated once a year on the part of the Czech territory where the vector form of cadastral map is available. Therefore, part of export units (map sheets of SM 5) has not a full coverage (price of such export unit is then proportionally reduced).</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b> Colour raster copies of so called Imperial Obligatory Imprints of the Stable Cadastre 1:2880 - Bohemia. These maps originate in 1826-1843 and originally were intended for archiving in the Central Archive of Cadastre of Lands in Vienna. After declaration of the Czechoslovak Republic they were handed over to Prague in frame of separation of archives. In contrast to so called Original Maps of Stable Cadastre they record the original state of landscape without drawings of later changes. Up to now they belong to the most demanded and to the most used Archival documents of the Central Archive of Surveying and Cadastre. There are approximately 8400 cadastral maps in approx. 31 thousands map sheets for the territory of Bohemia. In cadastral districts where these maps were not retained, these maps are being continuously replaced by original maps of the stable cadastre.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> The data were created by transformation of vector cadastral component of SM 5 to raster file. In territories, where vector SM 5 has not been created yet, the cadastral and altimetry components were created by scanning of individual printing masters of planimetry and altimetry from the last issue of the State Map 1:5,000 - derived. The cadastral component does not contain parcel numbers.</p>

The cartographic visualisation is solved automatically without manual works of a cartographer.

Therefore, part of export units (map sheets of SM 5) has not a full coverage (price of such export unit is then proportionally reduced).</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> Colour raster copies of so called Imperial Obligatory Imprints of the Stable Cadastre 1:2880 - Bohemia. These maps originate in 1826-1843 and originally were intended for archiving in the Central Archive of Cadastre of Lands in Vienna. After declaration of the Czechoslovak Republic they were handed over to Prague in frame of separation of archives. In contrast to so called Original Maps of Stable Cadastre they record the original state of landscape without drawings of later changes. Up to now they belong to the most demanded and to the most used Archival documents of the Central Archive of Surveying and Cadastre. There are approximately 8400 cadastral maps in approx. 31 thousands map sheets for the territory of Bohemia. In cadastral districts where these maps were not retained, these maps are being continuously replaced by original maps of the stable cadastre.</p>
